Currently, the major effort NEAT is focused on updating the code to Python 3. This is happening in the [python3_conversion branch](https://github.com/zstephens/neat-genreads/tree/python3_conversion). We are working on bringing the code up to [PEP 8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), as well as leveraging Biopython and Pandas to speed up analysis. Some work is still ongoing in Master branch, based on issues and bugs that have been raised in the Issues section. 

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes
 
Note: Be sure to merge the latest changes before making the pull request. You can increase your chances of a successfull pull request by indicating clearly what branch you are contributing to and making a detailed commit message. It also helps if you open an issue first to let us know you are working on this project.
